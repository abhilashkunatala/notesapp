### Base64
Base64 Encoding is used to convert binary
data into a text-like format that allows it to
be transported in environments that can handle
only text safely. Base64 encoding takes the original
binary data and operates on it by dividing
it into tokens of three bytes. A byte consists of
eight bits, so Base64 takes 24bits in total. These
3 bytes are then converted into four printable
characters from the ASCII standard.
